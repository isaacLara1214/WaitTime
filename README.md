### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Travel
- **Mobile:** since you will need to check the schedules on the go a mobile app is perfect when traveling through public transportation
- **Story:** Just as any driver checks their GPS to see how long it would take to get to their destination this app will help students keep in mind the wait time of the MARTA to fully plan their trip.

- **Market:** Students or Atlanta residents using the MARTA.
- **Habit:** Students will be checking the app everytime they are waiting for the train or heading to the station just as drivers check ETA when driving. 
- **Scope:** Version 1 will show all train stations and display the wait time for the two closest trains for each rail line and in which direction they are heading.
