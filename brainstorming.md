## activity 1 brainstorming 

Marta train wait time tracker app

- **Description**: App will show the wait time for the closest and second closest train to that station
- **Story**: Just as any driver checks their GPS to see how long it would take to get to their destination this app will help students keep in mind the wait time of the MARTA to fully plan their trip. 
- **Category**: Travel
- **Market**: Students using the MARTA public transportation system 
- **Mobile** since you will need to check the schedules on the go a mobile app is perfect when traveling through public transportation
- **Habit**: Students will be checking the app everytime they are waiting for the train or heading to the station
- **Scope**: version 1 will show all train stops with detials like the 1st and 2nd closest trains in any direction. it will also show the direction the train is heading with that wait time.
